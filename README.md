# Personal Website

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Author: Shaan Khan

The layout of the website takes inspiration from the google-site that I created:
https://www.old.shaankhan.me/

## Features
- Features a contact me form that uses AWS Lambda and AWS SES.  Click [HERE](https://github.com/ContactShaanKhan/Contact-Me-Form) for more details.
- Embedded Resume using [Mozilla's pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js).
- An entire page dedicated to the cutest dog Shadow.
- Color Pallete based on my favorite VS-Code theme [One-monokai](https://github.com/azemoh/vscode-one-monokai/blob/master/colors.scss).

## TODOs
### Short Term 
- Create a different view for mobile/table devices   
- Add a bar that indidicates how far in the page you scrolled like in: https://www.lifewire.com/jsx-file-2621849  
- Make layout.js less verbose   
- Add more to the resume page (like link to resume in google drive)  
- Maybe combine home and find me page

### Medium Term 

### Long Term
- Convert to typescript (Create release for javascript variant)


### BUGS

- Overlay for contact form is off-centered
