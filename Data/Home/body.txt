Thank you for visiting my site!

Whether you want to take a look at my resume or learn more about me, you have come to the right place and I'm glad to have you here. 

Letâ€™s start with a brief introduction.  I am a Computer Science graduate from Stony Brook University.  I enjoy working with JavaScript whether that be for website development through React or building some backend infrastructure in the cloud.  I also love to learn about operating systems and with that comes a joy of working with C.  

When I am not dealing with 1s and 0s, I enjoy playing with my dog Shadow, working on my 2009 Crown Victoria Police Interceptor (big things in store), taking photos with my Canon 5D classic, and listening to a vast variety of music including rock (both classic and modern).
